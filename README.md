The idea of this project is to create a shell/driver combination to create a secure way to use Linux. Utilizing a RP2040 basic board as the "key" or "wizard staff", the linux module is able to see and signal probe and disconnect events. From this, we created a shell that listens to those events, and creates an accessible shell only if the device is connected.
